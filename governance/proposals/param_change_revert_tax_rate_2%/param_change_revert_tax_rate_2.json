  "description": "# Title: Revert Community Pool Tax Rate to 2%\n\n*Authors*: [Atom Accelerator DAO & Oversight Committee](https://www.atomaccelerator.com/) \n\n## Summary  \n\nThis `param-change` proposal aims to revert the `community_tax` parameter from 10% (0.10) back to 2% (0.02), reinstating the baseline default rate that was in effect prior to [**Proposal 88**](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/88/).\n\n## Parameter Change\n\nThe proposed parameter change is managed by the \"distribution module\" in the Cosmos SDK.\n\n**Parameter**: `community_tax`\n\n`community_tax`: Defines the percentage of block rewards (including transaction fees and inflation rewards) that is diverted to the community pool before the remainder is distributed to validators and delegators. \n\nThe `community_tax` has these key characteristics:\n\n* It must be positive and cannot exceed 1.00 (or 100%).\n* The default value is set to 0.02 (2%) in the distribution module's default parameters. \n* Cosmos governance can adjust this parameter through on-chain `param-change` proposals.\n\n**Parameter and Proposed Value**\n\n| Module         | Parameter      | Current Value | Proposed Value |\n|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| `x/distribution` | `community_tax` | 0.10 (10%)     | 0.02 (2%)      |\n\n\n*If the parameter is set to*:\n\n0.02 → 2% of minted rewards go to the Community Pool\n\n0.10 → 10% of minted rewards go to the Community Pool\n\n\n## Background  \n\n[**Proposal 88**](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/88/) raised the community tax from 2% to 10% to enable long-term funding of the **Atom Accelerator DAO (AADAO)** and similar initiatives. This tax increase facilitated allocations of 588,000 ATOM via [**Proposal 95**](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/95/), and an additional 975,811 ATOM (plus a 100,000 ATOM bonus) via [**Proposal 865**](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/865/).\n\n\nAs of Q1 2025, AADAO has entered \"maintenance mode\" and has declined to renew or revise its mandate. In view of these circumstances, the justification for maintaining a 10% tax no longer applies.\n\n\n## Rationale for Reversion to 2%\n\n\n1. **Original Purpose of Tax Rate Increase No Longer Applies**  \n\n\n2. **Avoid Capital Oversupply and Misallocation**  \n\n   An excessive buildup of idle capital can attract value-extractive or poorly scoped spending proposals. \n\n\n3. **Decouple Tax Policy from Broader Governance Discussions**  \n\n   The Community Pool tax rate should reflect the network's actual operational needs; not serve as a catch-all for opportunism or act as a default placeholder for unresolved Treasury discussions and decisions.\n\n\n4. **Preserve Hub Autonomy with Fiscal Discipline**  \n\n   A 2% tax rate maintains a credible funding stream while keeping governance of the Hub's public resources independent, sovereign, tractable and reasonable.\n\n\n5. **Give More to Stakers**  \n\n   Assuming ~9.6 ATOM minted per block and ~4.36 million blocks/year:\n\n   - Reducing the tax from 10% to 2% returns **0.768 ATOM per block** to stakers.\n\n   - This results in approximately **3.34 million additional ATOM/year** in staking rewards.\n\n\n## **Clarification on Scope**  \n\nThis proposal **does not eliminate or reduce** existing Community Pool funds; which currently holds approximately 9.29 million ATOM. Decisions concerning the active balance, usage, governance structure, or potential reforms of the Community Pool should be addressed through subsequent and distinct governance proposals.\n\n\n## **Conclusion**  \n\nReducing the community tax rate to 2% is a prudent adjustment in the absence of an active Cosmos Hub governance-ratified funding mandate. This parameter change helps mitigate inadvertent capital accumulation, improves validator and staker economics, and reinforces fiscal discipline without compromising the Hub's ability to fund public goods and services independently.\n\nIt also establishes a more appropriate baseline for future governance discussions concerning long-term treasury management frameworks and strategic capital deployment from the Community Pool.\n\n\n## Links\n\n* [**Cosmos Hub Forum Discusssions**](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-reverse-proposal-88-revert-community-pool-tax-rate-to-2/15397)\n* [Cosmos SDK `x/distribution` module Documents](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/distribution)\n\n\n## **Voting Options**\n\n\n- **YES** – Supports reducing the Community Pool tax rate from 10% to 2%.\n  \n- **NO** – Opposes the proposed parameter change; maintain the current 10% tax rate.\n\n- **ABSTAIN** – Chooses not to take a position, due to a conflict of interest or a wish to participate without expressing a preference.\n\n- **NO WITH VETO** – Opposes the proposal on the grounds it is (1) irrelevant to the Cosmos Hub, (2) malicious and or unjustly harms minority interests, or (3) violates Cosmos Hub governance rules and or norms.",
